# APPLIED MOJO - Case study

Now we come to a case study - to implement a matrix type in Mojo by applying the knowledge we have learned in the previous chapters.

The matrix type is a fundamental data structure in numerical computing. It is not as complicated and flexible as and N-dimensional array (`NDArray`), but it is more efficient if we are only dealing with two-dimensional data. It is also a good data type to start with.

This case study is similar to a pull request to the NuMojo library ([PR #138](https://github.com/Mojo-Numerics-and-Algorithms-group/NuMojo/pull/138)) that introduces the matrix type. However, the case study is more concise and focused on basic functionalities.
