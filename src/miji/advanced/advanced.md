# Advanced

This part of the Miji focuses on the advanced features of Mojo, e.g., SIMD, parameterization, generics, traits, ownership, references, lifetime, etc. These topics are so different from Python that you need to pay some time understanding them. Knowing another compiled language like C++ or Rust will help you a lot in this part.
