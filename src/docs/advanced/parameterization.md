::: info Compile time vs runtime

Just to be concise, the **compile time** is the period when the code is being compiled into machine code, while the **runtime** is the period when the compiled code is executed on the machine. You can think that the compile time is when you type `pixi run mojo build file.mojo`, while the runtime is when you type `./file`. The ownership rules are checked at compile time, which means that any violation of the rules will be caught before the program are executed.
